Expense Reimbursement System

Project Description

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.


Technologies Used

Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Fetch API, Servlets

Features

Employees can sign in / sign out, view pending and resolved reimbursements, update employee information, and submit a new reimbursement request. The manager can sign in / sign out, view all employees, view all reimbursement requests, and approve / deny pending reimbursements. 

To-do list:

Add more functionality for the manager such as: sending an email confirmation after an approved / denied request, adding new employees, deleting employees, and adding the possibility for multiple managers with specified roles and restricted access to certain functionality.
Generally improve the UI for the entire website. Can transfer the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over to Angular for improved performance due to the single-page architecture.
